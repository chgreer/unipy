Subject: Re: SMT RCP and LCP sensitivities

Vincent,

Please find attached the system temperatures as recorded (measured) in
the SDD data file.  The variation between LCP and RCP is on the order
of a few percent.  This doesn't help to explain the large LL/RR results.

Tom wrote a special script that uses a utility he has to extract system
temperature information from each scan in the 2796 through 3363 range
from the SDD file.  The attached file has five columns; scan number, H-Pol
(RCP) LSB Tsys (K), H-Pol (RCP) USB Tsys (K), V-Pol (LCP) LSB Tsys (K),
and V-Pol (LCP) USB Tsys (K).

Were any "Cold Cal" measurements taken?  A "Cold Cal" result references the
temperature scale back to the physical temperature of LN.

The data must be correct but I'm concerned that it looks TOO good!  There
are 4 mixers and 4 LNAs in the 2 sideband separating mixers and yet the
system temperature ratios for the first scan across polarizations and
sidebands are less than 3.6%.  Could we be that good?  Receiver temperatures
are in the approximate range of 60 - 70 K.  We could investigate the
system temperature values further if you think it's necessary.


Thanks,
Robert
